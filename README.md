## Planning

- **Trello Board**: The team listed out various user stories for the e-learning platform on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dUDCGMn6/project-3). The user stories are sorted out into the MVP as well the Icebox. As progress was made on the e-learning platform, the user stories were sorted into their right locations respectively (WIP/completed).

- **Wireframe**: Based on the user stories which were listed out by the team, the team then created a [Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/6gmkSZuAMDI25RBv8hmiaE/Project-3---E-Learning-Platform-for-Financial-Literacy?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=5eElqKAEfjk6i8ll-0) to conceptualise how the FinCademy website would look like. During the creation of the website, several changes were made to the design but the wireframe served as a useful guide for the foundation that needed to be built.

- **ERD**: The team also did up the [Entity Relationship Diagrams](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/09dc7bdd-520f-41d8-9312-5ef9105101a9/edit?invitationId=inv_15befe1e-5c87-4bfa-aa0c-c912bd6210fc&referringApp=slack&page=0_0#) for the various models that we intended to have from the start. [Placeholder data and models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gra9SOT4H9hnbW0CrkVt6Pw95Psl-sN5Q52LE_Q5YX8/edit#gid=762001014) were also generated on Google sheets for the purposes of pitching our project.

- **Pitch Deck**: The entire idea was then pitched to our course instructor, using this [Pitch Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LGYF6woeVfOccvw7YVxU0RyAnfG7s322frx_3iul1Hg/edit#slide=id.p). The project was then green-lit but some components of the initial idea (to have instructors, course creation, etc.) had to be temporarily shelved in view of the timeline provided to complete the MVP for the project.
