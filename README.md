## Introduction

Financial literacy is more crucial than ever in today's fast-paced world. FinCademy aims to empower users by providing a well-rounded, easy-to-understand guide to financial literacy. From the basics like budgeting and saving to more advanced topics like investment and retirement planning, FinCademy provides an array of courses and resources for all users.

## Planning

- **Trello Board**: The team listed out various user stories for the e-learning platform on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dUDCGMn6/project-3). The user stories are sorted out into the MVP as well the Icebox. As progress was made on the e-learning platform, the user stories were sorted into their right locations respectively (WIP/completed).

- **Wireframe**: Based on the user stories which were listed out by the team, the team then created a [Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/6gmkSZuAMDI25RBv8hmiaE/Project-3---E-Learning-Platform-for-Financial-Literacy?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=5eElqKAEfjk6i8ll-0) to conceptualise how the FinCademy website would look like. During the creation of the website, several changes were made to the design but the wireframe served as a useful guide for the foundation that needed to be built.

- **ERD**: The team also did up the Entity Relationship Diagram ([ERD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/09dc7bdd-520f-41d8-9312-5ef9105101a9/edit?invitationId=inv_15befe1e-5c87-4bfa-aa0c-c912bd6210fc&referringApp=slack&page=0_0#)) for the various models that we intended to have from the start.
