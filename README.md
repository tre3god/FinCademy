## Introduction

Financial literacy is more crucial than ever in today's fast-paced world. FinCademy aims to empower users by providing a well-rounded, easy-to-understand guide to financial literacy. From the basics, like budgeting and saving, to more advanced topics like investment and retirement planning, FinCademy offers an array of courses and resources for all users.

## Planning

- **Trello Board**: The team listed out various user stories for the e-learning platform on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dUDCGMn6/project-3). User stories are categorized as MVP and Icebox items. As progress was made, the stories were moved to their appropriate categories (WIP/completed).

- **Wireframe**: Based on the user stories, the team created a [Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/6gmkSZuAMDI25RBv8hmiaE/Project-3---E-Learning-Platform-for-Financial-Literacy?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=5eElqKAEfjk6i8ll-0) to conceptualize the website's design. While the wireframe served as an initial guide, several modifications were made during development.

- **ERD**: The team also drafted an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/09dc7bdd-520f-41d8-9312-5ef9105101a9/edit?invitationId=inv_15befe1e-5c87-4bfa-aa0c-c912bd6210fc&referringApp=slack&page=0_0#)) for the various models planned from the start.
